# Game-Dev_Quick-Start
A quick-start guide for new developers looking for direction in the making games.

FAQ: 
Is This Guide Useful To Me? - I believe any junior in the field and industry of game development could gain at least a little bit of a benefit from this guide, unless you're looking for specialized information or career advice/guidance.

Repo-Status: Currently I have no plans to update this repo past this readme BUT I am open to commit requests if anyone would like to add to it.

As a bit of a motivational note: Time and efficiency are your only limiting factors, so best to get started now and learn as you go!
