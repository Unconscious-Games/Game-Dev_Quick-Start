A quick-start guide for new developers looking for direction in making games.

FAQ: 
Is This Resource Sheet Useful To Me? - Yes if you're a junior developer, be it hobbyist or indie, looking for a nudge in the right direction or idea on how to get started. No if you're looking for specialized or career advice.

Repo-Status: Currently I have no plans to update this repo past this readme BUT I am open to commit requests if anyone would like to add to it.

As a bit of a motivational note: Time and efficiency are your only limiting factors, so best to get started now and learn as you go!
